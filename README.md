# Euclidean Algorithm and Diophantine Equation

# Content
The program contains two methods gcf() and gcf2(). Both of these methods takes 2 numbers as a parameters.
`gcf()` method find Greatest Common Factor(Divisor) of provided numbers using Euclidean Algorithm.
`gcf2()` method find Greatest Common Factor(Divisor) of provided numbers and finds 2 multiples of each number to satisfy the Diophantine Equation.

`main()` function takes care of user input and output of the program.

*The program is Created for Math 245 taught by B. Lederman*
